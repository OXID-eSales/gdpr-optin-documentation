To export the data of a user from OXID eShop, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to the Admin Panel** of OXID eShop.

2. Navigate to the **Administer Users** section.

   - Use the search or scroll feature to locate the user for whom you want to export data.

3. **Select the user** to open their detailed information view.

4. In the user's details, you will find a button labeled **"Export User Data"** (or a similar name) located inside the **Main Tab**.

5. **Click the "Export User Data" button**.

   - The system will process the request and generate a ZIP file containing all available data associated with the user.

6. Once the export process is complete, a **ZIP file will be downloaded** via the browser. This file contains all relevant data for the user in a structured format.

7. After the download, the system triggers a **background cleanup process**. The temporary ZIP file on the server is automatically removed to ensure the server remains optimized and clutter-free.
